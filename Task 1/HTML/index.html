            <p>
                The place I was raised in is a place of music. Mostly on my mothers side of the family.
                On my dads side was a taste for music classical, gospel, but on my on my mom's side was
                variety. So both sides like jazz and Gospel. But the other side was perhaps more RnB my
                elder cousins introduced me to Hiphop and Rap. Then comes the year 2000 the release of DSTV.
                Trying to westernize us, and people assuming that because we one of those houses that have DSTV
                we were rich. I tried to stay humble to not be a smugg rich kid. It's only when I grew older I 
                realised we were middle class not rich. Those days the western shows were showing rock music mostly.
                Enter gutair hero and I feel like I'm actually playing this music I so like. Enter influence people 
                telling me it's just a phase not knowing how stubborn I actually am. Now I listen to heavy metal
                mostly. Still listen to rap, gospel, and jazz. but mostly rock and roll. So heres my playlist
